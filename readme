Introduction
The goal is to predict MWh grid loss in power grids using machine learning in Applied Data Science Course.

The data is provided by TrønderEnergi.

Notes from TrønderEnergi:
Day-ahead predictions: We need to predict the grid loss for the next day before 10 am the current day at an hourly resolution.

Delayed measurements: the measured values of load and loss are not received immediately, usually  5 days after. 

Incorrect data: There have been some measurements we received were incorrect, by a big margin. They have been marked in the dataset in the incorrect_data column. 
It is recommended to remove those data points before you start analysing the data.

Here, we built machine learning models for the prediction of grid1 loss.
